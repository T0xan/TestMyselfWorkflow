# Test Myself Workflow
This project was created to test my knowledge and skills, and in this repository you can see it. The project may be supplemented with new subprojects.
## Units Management
The purpose of this subproject is to test my design knowledge, some knowledge and ideas. It presents my implementation of simple unit management mechanics. I got this idea from a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/5givv_nXOiY?si=AoT3YL6pHgwSMoOy).
